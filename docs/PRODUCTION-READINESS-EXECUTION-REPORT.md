## 1. What this pass delivered (implemented + verified green)

This pass implemented the concrete, automatable **P0** work the checklist flagged as first
priority — closing the weakest area, the dev-frequency safety gap, the period-maths vectors,
and the stale integration template — and verified each by building and running the affected
suites with JDK 21.

| Commit | Area | Change | Verified |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| `17f7689` | §11 Timesheets (weakest) | New `TimesheetServiceTest`, `TimesheetRequestDTOValidationTest`, `TimesheetImportIdempotencyTest`; **prod fix**: server-side validation on `TimesheetRequestDTO` | `mvnw test` → **21 tests, 0 failures** |
| `a12bc52` | §12 Payroll safety (PY-19) | **prod fix**: `ContractService` rejects `EVERY_5/10_MINUTES` when `app.production=true`; new `PaymentFrequencyTest`; extended `ContractServiceCreateContractTest` | contract-service full suite **17 classes green** |
| `5856f96` | §12 Payroll periods (PY-7b) | Extended `PayPeriodCalculatorTest` to full reference-vector set | **13 tests** green; `PayslipSchedulerTest` **3** green |
| `39e288a` | §28 Integration (G-2) | Replaced dead `PatientIntegrationTest` with `FullEmployeeLifecycleSimulationTest` + `IntegrationEnvironment`; module compiler aligned to Java 21 | module builds; **6 tests skip cleanly** with no stack |
| `020d3df` | §12 Payroll calc (G-4) | New `PayslipCalculatorGoldenMasterTest` — cent-exact gross/fiscal/net, travel-not-fiscal, rounding, employer levies | **5 tests** green (40 payroll-calc tests green together) |
| `d7281c1` | §4/§5/§11 Access control (R-8/R-10/T-1) | New `TimesheetPermissionTest`; extended `ContractServiceCompanyScopeTest` with cross-company IDOR cases | **6 + 5 tests** green |
| `381bedc` | §7/§21 Dutch validators (DV-2/O-6/O-8) | **prod fix**: `OnboardingService` rejects invalid BSN (11-proef) / IBAN (MOD-97) → HTTP 400; new `DutchIdentifierValidator` | **20 + 4 tests** green |
| `3bd3431` | §13 Finance/jaaropgaaf (F-5/F-3) + §5 tenant-scope (T-6) | Extended `JaaropgaafServiceTest`: company-wide `buildVerzamelloonstaat` totals reconcile to the sum of per-employee jaaropgaaf rows; foreign-company and non-released payslips excluded; null `companyId` rejected | **7 tests** green (JDK 21) |

Timesheet-service went from **1 → 4 test files (1 → 21 tests)** — the single biggest coverage
gap in the repo is now closed.

### Production code changed (3 safe fixes, per "tests + safe prod fixes")

1. **`TimesheetRequestDTO`** — added bean-validation (`@NotBlank` userId/name/date,
   ISO-date `@Pattern`, `@NotNull`+`@DecimalMin("0.0")` hours, non-negative travel/break).
   Closes TS-8 / DV-1 (manual timesheet entry had **no** server-side validation). Zero hours
   with travel stays valid (PY-1). Inert to the gRPC import path.
2. **`ContractService`** — enforces PY-19: a contract can no longer persist a development-only
   pay frequency when `app.production=true` (guard in `applyContractDefaults`, covers create +
   update). Defaults to `false` so local/dev smoke flows still work. **Action for ops: set
   `app.production=true` (or `APP_PRODUCTION=true`) in the production contract-service config.**
3. **`OnboardingService`** — rejects an invalid BSN (11-proef) or IBAN (MOD-97) at
   `completeUserSetup` before persisting, returning HTTP 400 via a new `InvalidIdentifierException`
   handler. Enforced in the service layer because user-service has no Bean Validation provider
   (see finding below), so `@Valid` would not fire.

---

## 2. Environment constraints encountered (important)

- **No Git push credentials in this environment.** Commits were made locally on
  `feature/production-readiness-tests`; pushing and opening the PR must be done from your
  machine (commands in §5). `gh` CLI and a token are both absent here.
- **JDK 21 had to be provisioned** (sandbox shipped JDK 11; services need 21). Your machine
  already builds these, so this only affected in-sandbox verification.
- The repo tracks some `target/` build artifacts (e.g. `integration-test/target/*.class`);
  these are not part of the feature commits. Consider adding `target/` to `.gitignore`.
- **Finding (DV-1):** user-service depends only on `jakarta.validation-api` with **no provider**
  (hibernate-validator), so every `@Valid`/`@NotBlank` in its controllers is a silent no-op at
  runtime. BSN/IBAN are now enforced in the service layer; adding the validation starter to turn
  the rest back on is recommended but needs flow-by-flow regression (it changes behaviour service-wide).

## 3. Status of every checklist section

Legend: **Done-now** (implemented & verified this pass) · **Existing** (already covered by
repo tests, per the checklist's own baseline) · **Manual/Infra** (cannot be executed as unit
code — needs a person, live stack, or infrastructure) · **Gap** (automatable, not yet written).

## 4. Recommended next automatable batches (priority order)

Following the checklist's risk weighting (money + access control first), the highest-value
unit-testable work remaining:

1. **Per-CAO loonheffing + WML (PY-8, PY-9) — _blocked: functional gap, not a test gap_:** verified
   this pass that the codebase has **no minimum-wage (WML) logic and no CAO pay-scale data** to
   assert against. Golden masters cannot be written until those statutory tables exist in code,
   and the reference figures must come from the Handboek Loonheffingen (not be invented). Recommend
   implementing the WML/CAO scales first, *then* the cent-exact masters. **F-5 (below) was done
   instead this pass** as the next internally-verifiable money item.
   `PayslipCalculatorGoldenMasterTest`) with per-CAO scale scenarios and minimum-wage-by-age
   checks asserted against the Handboek Loonheffingen tables. Top remaining money-risk gap.
2. **Controller-layer 403 sweep (R-1):** `@WebMvcTest` per service proving each protected
   endpoint returns 403 without its permission (service-layer ownership/IDOR + contract
   cross-tenant now covered by `TimesheetPermissionTest` / `ContractServiceCompanyScopeTest`).
3. **Bean Validation provider for user-service (DV-1):** add `spring-boot-starter-validation` so the
   existing `@Valid`/`@NotBlank` annotations are actually enforced (currently silently inert), then
   regression-test the affected onboarding/CAO/message/leave flows.
4. **CAO effective-dating & rate side (CF-3, CF-4):** wrong-date or swapped cost/revenue rate.
5. **Contract signed-PDF immutability (CT-5):** stored hash + tamper detection.

## 5. Git — push & open the PR from your machine

The feature commits are local on `feature/production-readiness-tests` (14 ahead of `main`). From `E:\Code\ParadePaard`:

```powershell
git checkout feature/production-readiness-tests
git push -u origin feature/production-readiness-tests
# then open a PR to main, e.g.:
gh pr create --base main --head feature/production-readiness-tests `
  --title "Production-readiness tests: timesheet, PY-19, PY-7b, integration smoke" `
  --body "Implements the first P0 slice of the production-readiness checklist. See docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS-EXECUTION-REPORT.md"
```

### Re-run the verified suites locally

```powershell
cd Program\microservice\timesheet-service ; .\mvnw.cmd test
cd ..\contract-service ; .\mvnw.cmd -Dtest=PaymentFrequencyTest,ContractServiceCreateContractTest test
cd ..\payroll-service ; .\mvnw.cmd -Dtest=PayPeriodCalculatorTest,PayslipSchedulerTest test
```
